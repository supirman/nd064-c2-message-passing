# UdaConnect Architecture Decisions

Three message passing type used this project, they are: 

## Kafka Message Queue
As the project require to be able to handle large data volume ingestion, 
I use Kafka Message Queue for Location data which will have a lot data incoming from the conference ground.
Kafka will help to queue the location message before the Location data consumed by Location Consumer service.

## gRPC
I am assume that the location will come from embeded computer in conference or attendee mobile app.
To help make sure the data has proper format before come to the message queue, I use gRPC as front interface of Location Ingest service.
Then the data will be passed to Kafka message queue. 

## REST
As we want migrate the monolith API into microservice, 
I think it is wise to use REST since it will give faster result on the MVP development in the limited timeline. 
It will also minimize the change for the frontend web app.
I use REST message passing for the original splited service: Location service, Person service, and Connection service.
